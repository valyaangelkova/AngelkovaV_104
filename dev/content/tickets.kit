        <p>Interesting to know, for an easy buy
            - the tickets and subscriptions are individual and nominative  
            - they cannot be returned, exchanged or refunded
            - for beneficiaries of a discount rate, a supporting document can be 	  asked for access to the show
            - depending on the layout, access to the room may be refused to 	  latecomers</p>
