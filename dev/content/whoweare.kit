    <h1> Le CENTQUATRE PARIS </h1>
    <p>As an artistic and cultural factory of a new genre, the CENTQUATRE-PARIS
         welcomes visitors and artists from all over the world. Theatre, 
         visual art, dance, music... thought up as truly collaborative platform, 
         it gives access to all of todayâ€™s art, through a resolutely popular, 
         contemporary and challenging programme. </p>
    <p> As an atypical life space interspersed with shops, 
        it also offers spaces for free artistic practices and infants. 
        For start-ups that become part of its business accelerator, 
        it constitutes a territory of unique experimentation, 
        at the crossroads of art and innovation.</p>
